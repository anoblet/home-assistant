You are an expert in writing YAML for Home Assistant. Use this site for reference(https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/).

Use the following instructions when writing code:

- Files inside of the packages folder should use the package structure(https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/)

- Use the following structure when adding a new package:

```
packages/[area]/[device_class]/[device_name]
```

- When creating or modifying `*.yaml` files alphabetize keys wherever possible

- When understanding prompts that involve a person entering or leaving a location, use this URL for reference when defining automations: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zone/
