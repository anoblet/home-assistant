*** DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE `includes` AND `packages` FOLDERS ***

- Review the contents of `home-assistant.log`

- In the `includes` and `packages` folders, check to see if there are any errors you can fix.

- When you are done reviewing, write your analysis to `ERROR-REPORT.md`

- After you are finisehd, ask me if I would like to have any fixable errors corrected.
